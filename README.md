# week1.day3.pokemonBattlePlanning

## Instructions
1. You will be creating a simple game MVP that takes user input (keypress or mouse click) and has two Pokemon attack each other
    - You can have two players battle or have one player battle a computer opponent (youâ€™ll have to program the behavior for this).
2. First, wireframe with your game with your group
    - Consider what the user will see and interact with? How will score be displayed? What can represent a Pokemon Battle?
    - Once done, present your wireframe to your instructional team for approval.
      - If your wireframe is not approved, make any necessary revisions and try again.
      - *Note: this process of wireframing and creating an MVP is exactly how big ideas start and begin to secure funding.*
3. Plan out who in your group is responsible for what
    - Break down large tasks into smaller ones and assign these task accordingly
4. Once done, [move onto the next phase!](https://github.com/AllStarCodeOrg/week1.day3.pokemonBattle)
